# IoT-Enabled-Livestock-Location-Tracker
A system to track and monitor the cattle remotely. This application can assist farmers to track their lost or stolen livestock.
An innovative and flexible solution based on the exploitation and integration of geofencing, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is proposed
to enhance the livestock location tracking in response to the livestock activity.

 GPS and GSM based model are used for routing and tracking of object(eg. cow) through mobile in a large area outdoor environment.
 
---Geo Fencing is a specific software program that uses a global positioning system ( GPS) to define the virtual boundary on a map based upon real-world location.
